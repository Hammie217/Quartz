# New site in [Quartz](https://hammie217.github.io/Quartz/)!
Hey guys, thanks for finding my new website repo. The intent of this project is to create a "second brain" style site with the hope that this allows other people to learn and also as a way for me to shape my thoughts. If you are looking for my old website don't worry it's still available at [hammie217.github.io](https://hammie217.github.io/).

## Updating this in the future
For Hamish: If you've come back to this after a while off, make the changes locally using obsidian, once done use the command `npx quartz sync` which will build, commit and kick off the github pages flow to host the site.
