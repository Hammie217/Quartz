Welcome to my website, I've made many generations of my website over the last few years and it's always been sentimental to me, if not useful, to retain my old site for all, usually me, to go back and see. If you're looking for my old website or are just interested in the history of the site you can find it here: https://hammie217.github.io/

In my newest site I'm trying out a new approach, trying to make a "Second Brain" style website where I can share my knowledge to anyone willing to listen. For now a central part of what I will be talking about is Pharmaceutical[[Secondary Manufacturing]] but I'm keen to expand the site into everything I deem important.
