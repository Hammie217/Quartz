title: Hamish's notes

Welcome to my website, I've made many generations of my website over the last few years and it's always been sentimental to me, if not useful, to retain my old site for all, usually me, to go back and see. If you're looking for my old website or are just interested in the history of the site you can find it [Here](https://hammie217.github.io/oldSite/index.html)

In my newest site I'm trying out a new approach, trying to make a "Second Brain" style website where I can share my knowledge to anyone willing to listen. 

My intent with this approach is to hopefully make a website that allows you to find exactly what you need and only read what you need to but also make as much information available as possible.

My current site architecture is to focus on three distinct areas:
- [Second Brain Notes](/Notes/Notes.md) - An atomic note network
- [Recordings](/Recordings/Recordings.md) - (Hopefully) A set of videos explaining commonly asked topics in depth
- [Posts](/Posts/) - A space for more in depth writing about individual projects, events, thoughts etc...

For now a central part of what I will be talking about is Pharmaceutical [[Secondary Manufacturing]] but I'm keen to expand the site into everything I deem important.
