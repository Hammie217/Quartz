#3DPrinting
#### Introduction 
Over the last few years 3D printing as a technology has moved on leaps and bounds from being science fiction, to a research topic and now to complete availability to the general public with some really great technologies now out there.

As part of this technology maturity the barriers to entry are almost non-existent with industry leading printers costing less than £1,000, maintenance and setup almost disappearing as well as printing software being useable anyone with a computer and a mouse.

#### Benefits
For manufacturing sites that are looking to improve OEE, reduce cost, reduce deviations, improve safety and all round improve faster,  3D printing is a great tool with many benefits.

##### Continuous Improvement Tools
Continuous Improvement is not a new subject in manufacturing, but the ability to create anything you can think of in minutes/hours for pennies definitely is. Traditionally Poka-Yoke tools and 5S shadow boards can take weeks to make set you back thousands just in hardware, meaning some improvements simply aren't worth the time and money. Instead with 3D printing almost any improvement becomes tangible and can be implemented same day, not same month.

##### Obsolete part replacement
Throughout my time in the manufacturing world I struggle to count the number of times a single plastic cog, clip or housing has snapped after years of use and upon asking for a replacement I'm told, "That's obsolete now" or "We can't supply individual parts" leading to a massive bill from a supplier for a whole replacement unit of which I didn't need 99% of.
With 3D printing instead of replacing a whole unit, a quick 15 minute design in CAD,  30 minute print and 10p of plastic you have a bespoke gear ready to slide into place and save £5,000 in less than an hour.

##### Reduction of Stores Stock
All manufacturing sites in the world have some level of stock to keep on hand for maintenance and spare parts, the more parts stored the move covered you are but the more space and management required as well as increasing the likelihood of buying a part to sit on a shelf just to be thrown out after 10 years. 

Using 3D printing allows you to keep a digital library instead of a physical library of parts that can be printed on demand reducing storage costs, ordering costs, cost of waste as well as removing the risk of part obsolescence. 3D printing will not be a replacement for stores given certain part requirements but can massively reduce costs in the long run.
