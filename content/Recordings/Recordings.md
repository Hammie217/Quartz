I've found myself spending more and more time explaining and teaching topics to people in my industry especially engineers interested in the future of digitalisation or pharmaceutical equipment.

For anyone that knows me and my style of explanations, I love diagramming and visualising topics, I believe in doing it this way you start to understand the whole picture much more easily and can start to spot issues and ask smart questions.

My intent with this page is to put the effort into one recording explaining these important topics so that it can be used at any time by anyone.
