Granulation is the process of transforming a powder into small granules (larger particulate size). This can be completed using a small amount of liquid called [[Wet Granulation]] or through compression called [[Dry Granulation]] or sometimes not completed and the powder be directly taken to [[Tablet Pressing]]. 
Granulation is usually preceded by [[Blending]]
[[Wet Granulation]] is usually followed by a [[Fluidised Bed]] drying process before [[Blending]]
[[Dry Granulation]] is usually followed directly by [[Blending]]
