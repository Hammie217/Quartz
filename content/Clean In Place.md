Clean in place(More commonly CIP) is the process of cleaning a system whilst it is in place (aka not disassembled).
CIP is usually achieved through circulation/draining of hot (~80C) water ([[Water For Injection]]/[[Purified Water]] depending on requirements) for a certain time.
CIP requires all pipework to be [[drainable]] and for all surfaces to be cleaned.
CIP is commonly followed by [[Sterilisation In Place]].
