Hello everyone, this section of my website is dedicated to my "Second Brain" style website that can hopefully be used as a lookup for all to use and learn as much as you like about any topics I know about.

At the moment I'm focusing on my experience in Digitalisation and the [Pharmaceutical](/Notes/Pharma/) Industry. If you'd like to start reading, try using the search bar or graph view to find a topic you're interested in for example you can start at [[Kubernetes]] or [[Secondary Manufacturing]]  but the benefit of this approach is you can start or end anywhere.
