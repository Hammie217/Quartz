Aseptic is the property of a substance, system or process being free of microorganism contamination.

The distinction between Aseptic and [[Sterilisation]] is Sterilisation removes all microorganisms whereas Aseptic processing prevents the introduction of contamination.

Aseptic processing is a key part of manufacturing biological drugs where [[Terminal Sterilisation]] is not possible.
