A Leaflet is typically a piece of paper supplied as part of a product in the [[Carton]] containing product information and is a requirement of any drugs supplied.

There is an ongoing movement, in its early phases, to move away from leaflet supply where possible and replace with a digital information system through a consumer scannable QR code.
