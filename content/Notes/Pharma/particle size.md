Particles size can be reduced through [[Milling]] and increased through [[Granulation]] to meet the product requirements.

Particle size is usually a [[Critical Process Parameter]] and as such must be tested, particle size analysers are commonly placed inline in a process where possible allowing high levels of control and monitoring. For small particulate sizes though this can be complex and expensive and as such an offline test is still commonly used.
