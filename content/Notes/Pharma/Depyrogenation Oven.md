A depyrogenation oven is a piece of equipment used for [[Sterilisation]] which uses [[Dry Heat]]. A depyrogenation oven not only kills bacteria but also destroys [[pyrogens]]. A depyrogenation oven typically has a few operations:
- ?Venting? - Start heating with vents open to remove moisture
- Heating - Continue heating with vents closed to reach depyrogenation temperature
- Delay - Hold chamber at depyrogenation temperature until whole load is at depyrogenation temperature 
- Depyrogenation - Hold depyrogenation temperature until whole load has experienced depyrogenation duration
- Cooling - Cool load down to prevent injury once the door is opened
