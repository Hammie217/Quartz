Continuous Process Verification (CPV), is a process required in pharmaceutical manufacturing to monitor all [[Critical Quality Attribute]]s, [[Critical Process Parameter]]s and [[Critical Material Attribute]]s.
CPV requires these datapoints must be collected, stored and monitored throughout manufactured batches including statistical analysis on this data.
CPV helps to detect individual out of specification batches, step changes in output (pointing to possible manufacturing changes or supplied material changes), gradual changes (pointing to degradation of process).
