A Pallet Transfer machine (or Pallet Changer) is a piece of equipment that takes the load from one [[Pallet]] onto another.

These are commonly use to transfer from internal, site owned, pallets to cheaper wooden or plastic pallets for distribution.

Pallet Transfer systems commonly work through a "side pusher" format where a wall will push contents held on one pallet onto another.
