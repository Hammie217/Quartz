Assembly is the process of assembling a device, for injectable devices this this is commonly [[Autoinjectors]]. Assembly can be a very complex process due to many complex parts that can have no visual indication of correct installation.
For example for many devices require monitoring of [[Force-Distance]] to check correct assembly which can be vary depending on the device tolerances.
