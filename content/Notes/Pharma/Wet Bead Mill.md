Wet bead mills use small [[Beads]]/balls to mill product down, the size of these beads determines the efficient [[particle size]] that the bead mill can create. In a sterile environment the sterility of these beads can be just as complex as the milling itself, requiring a method to clean and sterilise. Commonly using a [[Fluidised Bed]], or other washer, and [[Depyrogenation Oven]] to achieve this.

A wet bead mill, mills product by agitating the product with hard [[Beads]] effectively smashing the product down splitting it into smaller and smaller particles. A bead mill usually recirculates product around a larger tank to increase the amount of product milled in one [[Unit Procedure]].
