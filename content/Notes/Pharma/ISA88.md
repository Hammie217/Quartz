ISA88 is a standard for batch control and standardises many terms and structures. ISA88 was released in 1995 and is in widespread use throughout industry as the batch control standard.
ISA88 defines both a Physical Model and a Procedural Model.

The physical model defines a [[Process Cell]] must contain [[Unit]]s, may contain [[Equipment Module]]s, may contain [[Control Module]].
This physical model means one structure can cover anything from a simple standalone pH meter as a Unit, or a multi building reactor.

The Procedural Model (Software/process model) defines a [[Procedure]] containing [[Unit Procedure]]s, containing [[Operation]]s, containing [[Phase]]s.

ISA88 also defines key recipe terminology and structure.
