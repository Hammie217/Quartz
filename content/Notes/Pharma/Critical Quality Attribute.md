A Critical Quality Attribute (or CQA) is an attribute chosen for a product that ensures that it is of the desired quality.
For example a product could have a CQA for the pH, Particle size, endotoxin content, sterility etc.. 
CQAs must be rigorously defined and then monitored as part of [[Continuous Process Verification]] as per FDA/other governing body requirements.
Manufacture parameters that directly impact CQAs are [[Critical Process Parameter]].
