Product thawing is the process of un-freezing [[Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]] ready for [[Manufacturing]] and is usually one of the first steps in the manufacturing process. Products that require thawing are usually [[Cold chain]] products. I usually use a [[Frozen chicken]] simile to describe the process. There are two main ways to that a product, [[Forced Thaw]] and [[Passive Thaw]]. Products that are thawed typically have a minimum thaw time before being allowed to be used.
