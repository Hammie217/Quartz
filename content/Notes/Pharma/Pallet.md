A pallet is a standardised format of holding good for transport. Pallets are most commonly wood but in clean manufacturing areas where contamination is a risk, metal or plastic is commonly used.

Pallets are commonly loaded with [[Case]]s filled with product using a [[Palletiser]] ready for distribution.

Many standard pieces of equipment exist that function around the use of pallets:
- [[Palletiser]]
- [[Pallet Transfer]]
- [[Pallet Stacker]]
- [[Pallet Wrapper]]
