A Case is a large box typically used for volume transport of [[Carton]]s. Cases can hold anywhere in the region of 10-100 cartons depending on size of carton and case. Cartons are packed into Cases in a [[Casepacker]].

For batches that are not minute, cases are packed onto [[Pallet]]s for easy mass transport using a [[Palletiser]].
