A Unit Procedure is an [[ISA88]] defined structure that belongs to a [[Procedure]] and contains [[Operation]]s. A Unit Procedure defines a set of steps required to run on a [[Unit]].

For example the [[Unit Procedure]] that runs on a [[Depyrogenation]] to process a load will follow a defined set of [[Operation]]s and the load will be used as part of a wider [[Procedure]].
