A puck is an object used to hold a part so that it can be carried on a [[Conveyor Belt]], pucks are used to hold complex parts in a simple way to allow a process to occur.

For example pucks are used in the [[Packing]] of [[Autoinjectors]] to hold the autoinjector whilst it passes through a [[Labeller]].

Pucks are loaded with a device using a [[Puck Loader]].
