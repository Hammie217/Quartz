Radio Frequency Identification is a wireless technology implemented through a small chip with limited memory connected to a coil that acts as both a wireless power supply and data antenna.

RFID is commonly implemented to identify objects, for example lanyards for security access to sites or applied to vessels to track proximity events (Enter/Exit rooms or vessel in location sensors).
