An autoinjector is a type of single use device used to deliver drugs to a patient. These devices are designed to be simple so that complex medicines that previously would require a healthcare professional to administer, such as [[Vials]] products, can be self administered saving time of both the healthcare team and patient.

Autoinjectors are made up of:
- [[Syringes]]
- [[Housing]]
- [[Power Pack]]
