A tray unloader is a piece of equipment used to unload parts from a tray. These are very commonly used in the [[Assembly]] and [[Packing]] of [[Autoinjectors]] due to the nature of discrete parts.

In [[Packing]] a Tray Unloader is commonly paired with a [[Puck Loader]] to move [[Autoinjectors]] out of a tray and into a [[Puck]] on a [[Conveyor Belt]] for further processing.

Tray unloaders commonly use a [[Robotic Arm]] to pick and place parts.
