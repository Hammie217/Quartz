A Tamper Evident Label(TEL) is a label designed to break in a way that allows someone to check if a product has been opened previously.

Tamper Evident Labels are a control to ensure a genuine product supplied cannot be modified before given to a patient. Pharmacists are required to verify TEL status before sale of products ensuring a genuine product is supplied.
