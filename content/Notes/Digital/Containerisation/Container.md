Containers are units of software that run to do a specific function, containers are based on [[Container Image]]s that define what the container is comprised of.

For example a [[Container Image]] for InfluxDB is released and I can consume that image at my house as a container running on my home [[Docker]] host to instantly have a running InfluxDB.
