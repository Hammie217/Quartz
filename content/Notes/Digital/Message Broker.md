A message broker is an application that stores messages in some form of memory, typically a [[Queue]], from data senders and allows reading of those messages from data readers.
Message Brokers commonly follow a [[PubSub]] architecture and depending on their requirements and some common examples are [[RabbitMQ]], [[Kafka]] and [[HiveMQ]].
